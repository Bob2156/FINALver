## Setup

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
2. Copy the example environment file and edit it with your values:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   # then open .env and fill in each variable
   ```

The `.env` file is excluded from version control so your secrets remain private.
